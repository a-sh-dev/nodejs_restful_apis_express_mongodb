# ⛓️ RESTful APIs with NodeJS, Express & MongoDB

Deepening my back-end skills by building RESTful APIs with NodeJS, Express and non-relational databases, MongoDB.

- Create and configure user creation password and user login with protection layer for sensitive data (password is hashed and is not visible on the database)
- Configure middlewares to authenticate login, update and delete requests
- Experimenting with `pnpm`. I used `pnpm` for this project. I highly encourage using it as a more performant `npm` or alternative to `yarn`.

## Instructions

Clone this repo then after installing `pnpm`, install the dependencies and run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start server
pnpm start
```
